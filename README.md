This extension uses a call to a free model (here deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528-qwen3-8b:free) on OpenRouter to show the webpage leaning and sentiment.

Sentiment varies at times, however on the tested webpages, the general public perception of the website held.
A few sites that were tested include Fox News, NBC, CNN and BBC.

Further updates will include the classification of propaganda and a custom-generated bias score for such webpages.
Another page will be published about the overall bias scores of major news corporations around the world.
